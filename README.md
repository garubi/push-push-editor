# Push Push editor

An editor for the configuration of [Push Push](https://github.com/garubi/push-push), a DIY device that you can easily build with Arduino [See here](https://github.com/garubi/push-push). Push Push allows you to send keystrokes to a computer by emulating a USB keyboard.

With this editor you can choose the keystrokes that each button of the Push Push sends to your computer.

The editor can work totally offline and can be installed on your desktop computer of tablet or cellphone, or you can use it on the fly [from here](https://garubi.github.io/push-push-editor/).

You can also export the Push Push configuration to a file and import it at a later time, building a simple library of buttons configurations.

You can find detailed instruction on its use directly in the app.
